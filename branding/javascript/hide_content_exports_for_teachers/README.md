# Hide Content Exports Page for Teachers

This snippet will replace the contents of the content export page with a message that the page is only available to administrators. This will remove the form to export content and the historic course content. It will not prevent teachers from using the API or other methods to export course content.

## Support
This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this documentation up-to-date.
